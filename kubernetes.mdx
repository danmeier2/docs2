3. Verify Deployments: kubectl get deployments -n vectorflow
4. Create a Tunnel: Establish a connection to the Kubernetes cluster with: minikube tunnel

## Benefits

Smooth Transition: Moving from a local Kubernetes cluster to a production environment is streamlined, ensuring a smooth transition from prototyping to production for your RAG application.
Easy data syncing and maintenance: Kubernetes makes it easy to run jobs on a schedule like syncing your upstream data with your vector DB and removing stale data.
Auto-Scaling and Recovery: These features are essential for managing fluctuating workloads.
Simplified Maintenance: Using microservices architecture on Kubernetes facilitates easier maintenance and scalability.
