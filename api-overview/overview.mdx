title: "Making requests"

To use VectorFlow for development, make an HTTP request to your API's URL - for example, localhost:8000 from your development machine, or vectorflow_api:8000 from within another docker container.

## Request & Response Payload

### Embed a Single File

To submit a single file for embedding, make a POST request to the /embed endpoint with a file attached, the 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' header and the following payload:

```
{
    'SourceData=path_to_txt_file'
    'LinesPerBatch=4096'
    'EmbeddingsMetadata={
        "embeddings_type": "OPEN_AI | HUGGING_FACE | IMAGE",
        "chunk_size": 512,
        "chunk_overlap": 128,
        "chunk_strategy": "EXACT | PARAGRAPH | SENTENCE | CUSTOM",
        "hugging_face_model_name": "sentence-transformer-model-name-here"
    }'
    'VectorDBMetadata={
        "vector_db_type": "PINECONE | QDRANT | WEAVIATE | MILVUS | REDIS | LANCEDB | MONGODB",
        "index_name": "index_name",
        "environment": "env_name"
    }'
    'DocumentID=your-optional-internal-tracking-id'
}
```

This will create a `job` and you will get the following payload back:

```
{
    message': f"Successfully added {batch_count} batches to the queue",
    'JobID': job_id
}
```

Right now this endpoint only supports uploading single files at a time, up to 25 MB due to timeout issues. Note that it may be deprecated.

### Embed Multiple Files At Once

To submit multiple files for embedding, make a POST request to the /jobs endpoint. The payload is the same as for single file embedding except the way you attach multiple files is different:

```
{
    'files=[
        ('file',  ('test_pdf.pdf', open(file1_path, 'rb'), 'application/octet-stream')),
        ('file', ('test_medium_text.txt', open(file2_path, 'rb'), 'application/octet-stream'))
    ]'
}
```

NOTE: You must stream the files to the endpoint, not send it as a conventional post request or it will fail.

This endpoint will create one job per file uploaded. You will get the following JSON payload back:

```
{
    'successful_uploads': successfully_uploaded_files,
    'failed_uploads': failed_uploads,
    'empty_files_count': empty_files_count,
    'duplicate_files_count': duplicate_files_count
}
```

Where successfully_uploaded_files is a list of tuples containing (file name, job id) and failed_uploads is a list of file names that failed to upload so you can retry them.

## Get Job Status

### Get a Single Job Status

To check the status of a job, make a GET request to this endpoint: `/jobs/<int:job_id>/status`. The response will be in the form:


```
{
    'JobStatus': job_status
}
```

### Get Multiple Job Statuses

To check the status of multiples job, make a POST request to this endpoint: /jobs/status. The request body will be in the form:

```
{
    'JobIDs': job_ids
}
```

and the response will be in the form

```
{
    'Jobs': [{'JobID': job_id, 'JobStatus': job_status}, ...]
}
```

There is an example in testing_clients/get_jobs_by_ids.py.
