## Vector Database Standard Metadata Schema

VectorFlow enforces a standardized schema for uploading data to a vector store:

```
id: string
source_data: string
source_document: string
embeddings: float array
```

The id can be used for deduplication and idempotency. Please note for Weaviate, the id is called vectorflow_id.

We plan deprecicate this in the near futuer to support dynamically detected and/or configurable schemas down the road.
