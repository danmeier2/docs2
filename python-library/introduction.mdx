description: "Use this Python client to embed documents with VectorFlow and check on the status of those embeddings."

## How to Use

The client has 2 methods for uploading documents to embed and 2 for checking statuses, listed below. All four methods return a python response object from the python requests library. You must parse the response using the .json() method.

```
pip install vectorflow-client
```

### Initialize

By default, this will set up vectorflow to embed files locally and upload them to a local instance of qdrant. It assumes you follow the default configuration in the VectorFlow repository's setup.sh which runs a collection of docker images locally using docker compose that will embed the documents with Open AI's ADA model and upload it to a local Qdrant instance.

```
from vectorflow_client.vectorflow import Vectorflow

vectorflow = Vectorflow()
vectorflow.embedding_api_key = "YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY"

```

### More Granular Control

For more granular control over the chunking, embedding and vector DB configurations, override default values on the Vectorflow class or on its `embeddings_metadata` and `vector_db_metadata` fields. For example:

```
from vectorflow_client.vectorflow import Vectorflow
from vectorflow_client.embeddings_type import EmbeddingsType
from vectorflow_client.vector_db_type import VectorDBType

vectorflow = Vectorflow()

# use open source sentence transformer model
vectorflow.embeddings_metadata.hugging_face_model_name = "thenlper/gte-base"
vectorflow.embeddings_metadata.embeddings_type = EmbeddingsType.HUGGING_FACE

# use Pinecone
vectorflow.vector_db_metadata.vector_db_type = VectorDBType.PINECONE
vectorflow.vector_db_metadata.environment = "us-east-1-aws"
vectorflow.vector_db_metadata.index_name = "test"

```
