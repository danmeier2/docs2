title: "Image Embedding"
description: "VectorFlow can embed images using the Image2Vec library. It will create a 512 dimensional vector by default from any image. You can also perform a Top-K image similarity search."

## How to Use Image Upload

Send a POST request to the /images endpoint to utilize this capability. You pass the same set of fields in VectorDBMetadata as you would for the /embed or /s3 endpoints but for EmbeddingsMetadata you only need to pass "embeddings_type": "IMAGE"

The docker-compose file will not spin this capability up automatically. Either run app.py --model_name your-sentence-transformer-model, or build and run the docker image in src/images with:

```
docker build --file images/Dockerfile -t vectorflow_image_embedding:latest .
docker run --network=vectorflow --name=vectorflow_image_embedding -d --env-file=/path/to/.env vectorflow_image_embedding:latest
```

Note that the Image2Vec uses the ResNet 18 by default. You can configure it to run larger models with higher dimensionality for more fine-grained embeddings. These take several minutes to download the weights from the source. VectorFlow does not provision hardware, so you must ensure your hardware has enough RAM/VRAM for the model. By default, VectorFlow will run models on GPU with CUDA if available.

## How to Use Image Search

Performing an image similarity search requires running another service. You can build and run it using docker:

```
docker build --file images/Dockerfile.search -t vectorflow_image_search:latest .
docker run --network=vectorflow --name=vectorflow_image_search -d --env-file=/path/to/.env vectorflow_image_search:latest
```

### Request

To perform a search, send a POST request to /images/search endpoint with an image file attached, the 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' header and the following body:

```
{
    'ReturnVectors': boolean,
    'TopK': integer, less than 1000,
    'VectorDBMetadata={
        "vector_db_type": "PINECONE | QDRANT | WEAVIATE | MILVUS | REDIS",
        "index_name": "index_name",
        "environment": "env_name"
    }'
}
```

All requests require an HTTP Header with Authorization key which is the same as your INTERNAL_API_KEY env var that you defined before (see above). You must pass your vector database api key with the HTTP Header X-VectorDB-Key if you are running a connecting to a cloud-based instance of a vector DB.

### Response

An image similarity search will return a response object containing the top K matches, plus the raw vectors if requested, with of the following form:

```
{
    "similar_images": list of match objects
    "vectors": list of list of floats
}
```

where `match` objects are defined as:

```
{
    "id": str,
    "score": float,
    "metadata": {"source_document" : str}
}
```
