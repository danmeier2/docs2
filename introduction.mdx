VectorFlow is an open-source platform designed to build data pipelines to provide up-to-date and external data to AI applications. It streamlines the process of ingesting unstructured data, pre-processing, embedding and storing in vector databases. The platform's API and Python library allow easy configuration and experimentation with chunking methods, metadata strategies, and open-&closed-source embedding models, helping developers optimize the performance of AI applications. Its infrastructure supports large-scale data ingestion reliably while keeping the data within your cloud.
